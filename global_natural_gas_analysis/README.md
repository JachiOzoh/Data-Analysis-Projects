# Global Natural Gas Supply Trends and Forecasting
## Problem Statement

Natural gas is one of the most important global energy sources, powering electricity, heating, and industrial production. Governments, energy companies, and investors all rely on supply forecasts to plan infrastructure, balance markets, and make long-term strategic decisions.
Accurate forecasting helps anticipate shortages, stabilize prices, and guide energy transition policies.

## My Role & Tools Used

This project was completed independently as a portfolio project to showcase applied data analysis skills.
I used:

1. Python for analysis and modeling
2. pandas & numpy for data wrangling
3. matplotlib & seaborn for visualization
4. scikit-learn for regression, preprocessing, and evaluation

## Key Steps in the Workflow

1. Data Cleaning: Standardized units and prepared time-series features
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized global and regional production trends
3. Model Building: Applied linear regression for forecasting supply
4. Evaluation: Assessed performance with R² and RMSE
5. Forecasting: Generated future supply projections

## Results

Global production shows a consistent upward trend with regional variation
The model achieves a strong fit with an R² score of 0.97.
Forecasts indicate  growth in production through 2030

## Portfolio Angle

1. This project demonstrates my ability to:
2. Work end-to-end on a real-world time series / forecasting problem
3. Apply regression and feature engineering to energy-sector data
4. Produce clear visualizations and insights that tell a story
5. Build reproducible, well-structured projects suitable for professional review
